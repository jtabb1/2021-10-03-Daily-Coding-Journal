    <p> 
      Coding-wise, late last night and early this morning I read 
      about sessions and cookies, and early this morning I 
      completed a lab on that subject.

    <p> 
      Today I plan on working on authentication and authorization 
      for my project, and hopefully I will get that working locally 
      on my machine and my pie in the sky hope is that I will get it 
      all hosted by early tomorrow morning.  I also need to go to 
      the gym today, eat, and work on my account of what happened 
      with a tenant who threatened to kill me last week.
